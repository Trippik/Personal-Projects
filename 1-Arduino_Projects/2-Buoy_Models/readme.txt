All of the included scripts are adrunino compatible and can be flashed to any Arduino board using the Ardunio IDE freely available
online (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or through the microsoft app store.

Each of the scripts is a looping light seqeunce that will repeat as long as the switch wired to the microcontroller is on.
The pin out for all scripts is as follows:
PIN 3 = LED
PIN 2 = Control Switch
